# Modern C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and STL

This repository contains coding challenges, exercises, and projects from the **"Beginning C++ Programming"** course on Udemy. It focuses on learning the fundamentals of C++ with an emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Course Overview

The Udemy course covers key concepts in C++ programming, including:

- Basics of C++ syntax
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (loops, conditionals, etc.)
- Functions and recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming principles (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.)
- Memory management (pointers, dynamic memory, etc.)
- C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course sections, each containing coding challenges and exercises from that specific section.

Each section includes:

- **Challenges**: Exercises to reinforce the concepts taught in the course.
- **Solutions**: My solutions for each challenge or exercise.

## How to Use

You can clone this repository to explore the solutions and understand how to approach the problems.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amolsatsangi/modern-C-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-and-STL.git
cd modern-C-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-and-STL
```

## Running the Code
To compile and run the C++ programs:

- Make sure you have a C++ compiler (such as g++) installed.
- Compile the file using the following command:

```bash
g++ -o output challenge1.cpp
./output
```
